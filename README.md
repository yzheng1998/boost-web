Boost Financeâ€™s mission is to create more impactful and scalable financial security for workers by partnering with employers to more comprehensively and creatively design and deliver grant funds. To this end, we will develop a framework through which to gauge impact, experiment with innovative design, expand the evidence base and publicly communicate the findings.

## Project Structure

The repo was built by the general frontend web file structure conventions we use at DEV. It has react-router, apollo-client, and ThemeProvider from styled-components set up in src/App.js. It also has a full devloper environment with prettier, eslint, and travis set up.

## Set up

To install all dependecies run:

```bash
$ npm i
