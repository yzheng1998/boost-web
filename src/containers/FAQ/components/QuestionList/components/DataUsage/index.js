    All data collected through the Grant Circles web application, surveys, and
    from your employer, are used for research purposes only. We also use some
    data, such as the information and documentation submitted with fund
    requests, to evaluate whether and how much to disburse to pilot
    participants. We will never sell your data or share it in an individually
    identifying manner. We will leverage learnings from the pilot to improve the
    Grant Circles offering, and will share aggregate learnings with our funders
    and partners. Additional detail about data use can be found in the Terms and
    Conditions.
